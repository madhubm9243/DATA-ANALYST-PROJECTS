# 💰 Profit Segmentation – Unlocking High-Value Customers

> 🔍 **A strategic Excel dashboard to identify your most profitable customers — and eliminate low-ROI segments.**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Insurance companies often treat all customers equally — but in reality, a small group drives the majority of profit.  
This project uses **Microsoft Excel** to build a full **Profit Segmentation System** that classifies customers into:

- 🟢 **High Value**  
- 🟡 **Mid Value**  
- 🔴 **Low Value**  

It empowers marketing, sales, and retention teams to focus on high-impact segments and reduce wasted spend.
